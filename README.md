# Digit-Recognition-MNIST-Keras

Digit Recognition on MNIST Data via Keras 

The repository aims to perform basic classification of MNIST data via CNN using Keras.
The code basically provides a quick overview on how to create a Neural Network in Keras and how Data Augmentation can be done using Keras to improve the training dataset.
The .ipynb and .html files are in Python-Files folder. 
The data is in MNIST-Data folder.
